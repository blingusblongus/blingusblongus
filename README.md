# Oh, hello!

### Nice of you to drop by. 

Talk to me about Advent of Code or Vim, or help me find the bugs in my latest micro-project (Cribbage API)

<!--
*Don't mind that ancient google scripts repo in the corner; I assure you, he's harmless.* ðŸ’€
  
Check out my pinned projects, or take a look at the solo project I created while at Prime Academy: [Cribbage Training Mobile App](https://github.com/blingusblongus/cribbage-trainer-solo-project)

### Feel free to take a look around - just give me a holler if you need anything :)
